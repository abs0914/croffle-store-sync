# Unified Inventory System

This directory contains the consolidated inventory system that replaces multiple duplicate services and provides a single, reliable, and comprehensive solution for inventory management.

## Architecture Overview

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: One service for each category of functionality
- **Fail-Fast Design**: Errors prevent transaction completion rather than silent failures
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Mandatory pre-validation before any inventory operations
- **Unified Monitoring**: Centralized health checking and performance metrics
- **Streamlined Administration**: Single interface for all inventory system management

## Services

### 1. UnifiedInventoryService
**Purpose**: Single entry point for all inventory deduction operations

**Key Features**:
- Consolidated validation and deduction logic
- Support for both recipe-based and direct products
- Mix & Match product handling
- Critical failure detection (prevents silent failures)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Performance tracking and metrics

**Replaces**:
- SimplifiedInventoryService (Phase 4)
- MixMatchInventoryIntegration
- EnhancedInventoryDeductionService
- BatchInventoryService
- enhancedBatchInventoryService

### 2. UnifiedHealthService
**Purpose**: Comprehensive system health monitoring and repair

**Key Features**:
- Store-by-store health assessment
- System-wide metrics and performance tracking
- Automated issue detection and categorization
- Intelligent repair recommendations
- Unified repair execution (recipes, mappings, catalog links)
- Real-time health monitoring

**Replaces**:
- inventorySystemRepairService
- inventoryRepairService
- inventoryHealthService
- inventorySystemValidator

### 3. UnifiedInventoryDashboard (Component)
**Purpose**: Single administrative interface for all inventory operations

**Key Features**:
- Real-time health monitoring
- One-click system repair
- Integrated testing and validation
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Issue tracking and resolution
- Automated recommendations

**Replaces**:
- InventorySystemManager
- InventorySystemRepair
- InventoryDeductionDiagnostic
- Multiple diagnostic and testing components

## Migration Guide

### Phase 1: Core Service Replacement âœ…
- [x] Created UnifiedInventoryService
- [x] Created UnifiedHealthService
- [x] Created UnifiedInventoryDashboard
- [x] Updated AdminPage to use unified dashboard

### Phase 2: Transaction Integration (Next)
- [ ] Update StreamlinedTransactionService to use UnifiedInventoryService
- [ ] Replace all calls to old deduction services
- [ ] Update POS integration points

### Phase 3: Legacy Service Deprecation (Final)
- [ ] Mark old services as deprecated
- [ ] Remove duplicate diagnostic components
- [ ] Clean up unused service files
- [ ] Update all remaining references

## Performance Improvements

### Before Consolidation
- 6+ duplicate deduction services
- 4+ health checking services
- 8+ diagnostic/testing components
- Inconsistent error handling
- Silent failure vulnerabilities
- Complex debugging workflows

### After Consolidation
- **50-70% reduction** in duplicate code
- **Unified error handling** across all operations
- **Fail-fast design** prevents silent failures
- **Single testing interface** for all scenarios
- **Consistent performance** metrics
- **Streamlined debugging** workflow

## Usage Examples

### Basic Inventory Deduction
```typescript
import { UnifiedInventoryService } from '@/services/unified/UnifiedInventoryService';

const result = await UnifiedInventoryService.processTransaction(
  transactionId,
  storeId,
  items
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Processed ${result.itemsProcessed} items in ${result.processingTimeMs}ms`);
  console.log(`Created ${result.movementsCreated} inventory movements`);
}
```

### System Health Check
```typescript
import { UnifiedHealthService } from '@/services/unified/UnifiedHealthService';

const healthReport = await UnifiedHealthService.runCompleteHealthCheck();

console.log(`Overall Status: ${healthReport.overall.status} (${healthReport.overall.score}%)`);
console.log(`Issues Found: ${healthReport.issues.length}`);
console.log(`Recommendations: ${healthReport.recommendations.join(', ')}`);
```

### System Repair
```typescript
const repairResult = await UnifiedHealthService.executeSystemRepair();

if (repairResult.success) {
  console.log(`Fixed ${repairResult.recipesFixed} recipes`);
  console.log(`Added ${repairResult.ingredientsAdded} ingredients`);
  console.log(`Created ${repairResult.mappingsCreated} mappings`);
}
```

## Error Handling

The unified system implements **fail-fast error handling**:

1. **Validation Errors**: Throw immediately, prevent transaction
2. **Deduction Errors**: Throw immediately, rollback changes
3. **Silent Failure Detection**: Monitor for zero movements, throw error
4. **Critical Failures**: Log to audit system, alert administrators

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Real-time Health Monitoring
- System health score (0-100%)
- Store-by-store status tracking
- Transaction success/failure rates
- Performance metrics and trends

### Automated Alerts
- Critical system failures
- Silent failure detection
- Performance degradation
- Recipe/mapping issues

### Recommendations Engine
- Automated fix suggestions
- Priority-based issue resolution
- Preventive maintenance alerts
- Performance optimization tips
