/**
 * ARCHITECTURE CLEANUP COMPLETED âœ…
 * 
 * NEW: SIMPLIFIED INVENTORY AUDIT SYSTEM
 * - inventory_movements: SINGLE audit table (all inventory changes)
 * - Simple deductWithAudit method for all deductions
 * - Non-blocking audit logging with retry mechanism
 * - Maintains feature compatibility while simplifying architecture
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Use SimplifiedInventoryAuditService.deductWithAudit() for all deductions
 * - Use SimplifiedInventoryAuditService.deductTransactionItems() for POS transactions
 * - All audit records go to inventory_movements only
 * - inventory_transactions table is deprecated for new operations
 * 
 * RESULT: Clean, reliable, single-table audit system
