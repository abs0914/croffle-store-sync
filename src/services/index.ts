/**
 * ARCHITECTURE CLEANUP COMPLETED âœ…
 * 
 * NEW: ENHANCED INVENTORY DEDUCTION SYSTEM WITH MIX & MATCH SUPPORT
 * - Smart detection of Mix & Match products (Croffle Overload, Mini Croffle)
 * - Intelligent ingredient categorization (base, choice, packaging)
 * - Only deducts base + selected choices + packaging (not ALL ingredients)
 * - Automatic fallback to regular deduction for standard products
 * - Comprehensive logging and debug information
 * 
 * PREVIOUS: SIMPLIFIED INVENTORY AUDIT SYSTEM
 * - inventory_movements: SINGLE audit table (all inventory changes)
 * - Simple deductWithAudit method for all deductions
 * - Non-blocking audit logging with retry mechanism
 * - Maintains feature compatibility while simplifying architecture
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Use SimplifiedTransactionInventoryIntegration.processTransactionInventory() for ALL transactions
 * - System automatically detects Mix & Match products and uses smart deduction
 * - Regular products continue to use standard deduction logic
 * - All audit records go to inventory_movements only
 * 
 * RESULT: Accurate inventory deduction for Mix & Match products, eliminating over-deduction issues
