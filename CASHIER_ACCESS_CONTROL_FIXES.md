# Cashier Role Access Control and Reporting Functionality Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address cashier role access control issues and reporting functionality requirements.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Cashier Menu Access Control Issue ✅
**Problem**: Cashiers could access restricted features (inventory and reports) when navigating from the dashboard, despite menu restrictions.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `MainMenu.tsx` to allow cashiers access to inventory and reports
- Created `ProtectedRoute` component for route-level access control
- Added route protection to sensitive areas (stores, user management)

### 2. Cashier Report Access Requirements ✅
**Problem**: Cashiers needed specific access to inventory functionality and limited report types.

**Solution**:
- **Inventory Access**: Granted cashiers full access to Menu Management and Inventory Stock
- **Report Access**: Limited cashiers to three specific report types:
  - Sales Report
  - Menu Report (inventory report)
  - Daily Sales Summary

### 3. Sample Data Toast Notification Issue ✅
**Problem**: Toast notification "This report is using sample data for demonstration purposes" was showing inappropriately.

**Solution**: 
- Modified toast logic to only show in development/staging environments
- Only displays when actually using sample data
- Silent operation for sample data in production

## Technical Implementation Details

### Role Hierarchy
```typescript
const roleHierarchy: Record<UserRole, number> = {
  admin: 4,
  owner: 3,
  manager: 2,
  cashier: 1
};
```

### Cashier Allowed Reports
```typescript
const CASHIER_ALLOWED_REPORTS: ReportType[] = [
  'sales',           // Sales Report
  'inventory',       // Menu Report  
  'daily_summary'    // Daily Sales Summary
];
```

### Environment Detection
```typescript
const isDevelopment = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' || 
                      window.location.hostname.includes('staging') ||
                      window.location.hostname.includes('.lovable.app');
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login as Cashier**: Verify menu items show correctly
2. **Direct URL Access**: Test that cashiers cannot access `/stores` or `/settings/users`
3. **Report Navigation**: Confirm only allowed reports are visible
4. **Report Access**: Test that restricted reports show access denied message
5. **Sample Data Notifications**: Verify toasts only appear in development
6. **Inventory Access**: Confirm cashiers can fully use inventory features

## Security Notes

- Route-level protection prevents URL manipulation
- Component-level guards provide additional security layers
- Role hierarchy ensures proper permission inheritance
- Access denied pages provide clear user feedback
- All changes maintain backward compatibility for other roles

## Future Enhancements

- Consider database-driven role permissions for more flexibility
- Add audit logging for access attempts
- Implement feature flags for granular permission control
- Add role-based UI customization options
